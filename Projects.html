            IMAGE SIZE COMPRESSOR
          </p>
          <p>
            I also built an image size compressor which is a tool or software that reduces the file size of an image without compromising on its quality. This can be done by reducing the resolution, removing unnecessary metadata, and using compression algorithms. Image size compression can help to reduce the load time of a website, save storage space, and make it easier to share images via email or social media. When using an image size compressor, it's important to keep in mind that reducing the file size too much can result in a loss of image quality. It's recommended to compress the image to the lowest possible file size without noticing a difference in the quality of the image. Additionally, it's also important to keep backups of the original images before compressing them in case the compressed images are not suitable for the intended use.The code for the image compression algorithm was written using JavaScript. There are libraries like canvas, web-workers, and other image processing libraries were used to process the image. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used to create a user interface that allows the user to select an image, set the compression level, and view the compressed image. I also tested the compressor on different types of images to ensure it can compress them effectively without a noticeable loss in quality. This complex task requires knowledge of client-side web development, image processing, and compression techniques. Additionally, the compression algorithm should be optimized for speed and efficiency and the final result should be compatible with different browser versions.

            Phone Location tracker
          </p>
          <p>
            A phone location tracker is a tool or software that is used to track the location of a mobile phone. This can be done through the use of GPS technology built into the phone, or through the use of software or apps that are installed on the phone.
There are many different types of phone location trackers available, including those that are designed for personal use, such as tracking the location of family members, and those that are designed for business use, such as tracking the location of employees or company-owned devices.
Python is a versatile programming language that can be used for a wide range of tasks, including mobile device programming so it can be used in developing phone location tracker.
First I gather the requirements that is I analyzed what the user needs and what functionality the location tracker should have. Then I collected location data from the mobile device using GPS, cellular, or Wi-Fi technologies. Python libraries such as geopy or py-gps was used to access the GPS data from the device. After I stored the collected location data in a database or file. Python's built-in libraries such as SQLite3 or Pandas can be used to store the data. I also used Python libraries such as NumPy or SciPy to analyze and process the location data. I created a user interface with the help of Python libraries such as Tkinter or PyQt  that allows the user to view the location data and track the device in real-time. Finally I packaged the code into an executable file and install it on the mobile device. It is a complex task which requires knowledge of both Python and mobile device programming. It's also important to be aware of the laws and regulations regarding phone tracking and location data collection in your region.

            DIGITAL MUSIC SERVICE
          </p>
          <p>
            I created a digital music service that allows users to access and play music online. These services typically offer a large library of songs that can be streamed or downloaded for offline listening. My digital music services also offer additional features such as playlists, and social sharing. I used JavaScript and a server-side framework Node.js to implement the backend of the digital music service. This includes handling user authentication, storing user data, and integrating with the chosen music API. JavaScript, HTML, and CSS was used to implement the frontend of the digital music service. This includes creating the user interface and implementing features such as personalized playlists, music discovery, and social sharing. We tested the service on different devices and browsers to ensure it works properly and efficiently. Developing a digital music service can be a complex task and requires knowledge of web development, music APIs, and server-side programming. Additionally, the service should be optimized for speed and efficiency and be compatible with different browser versions. It's also important to be aware of copyright laws and regulations regarding music streaming and usage.

            MY CLOUD
          </p>
          <p>
I created a personal cloud storage service called ‘My Cloud’, which is a type of cloud computing service that allows individuals to store, access and share their files and data over the internet. This type of service is typically accessed through a web interface or mobile app, and allows users to upload and download files, create and share folders, and access their files from anywhere with an internet connection. My Cloud services can be a convenient way for individuals to store and access their files, as they allow users to access their files from any device with an internet connection and also provide a way to share and collaborate with others. However, it's important to note that these services are usually less secure than an enterprise cloud service, and users need to be aware of the security features provided by the service and take necessary precautions. I researched and selected the appropriate technology stack for the cloud service such as the operating system, web server, and databases. I designed the architecture of the cloud service, including the hardware, network, and software components. I used the selected technology stack to implement the backend of the cloud service. This includes handling user authentication, storing and managing files, and handling requests and responses. JavaScript, HTML, and CSS were used to implement the frontend of the cloud service. This includes creating the user interface and implementing features such as file upload, download, and sharing. Developing a cloud service can be a complex task and requires knowledge of web development, server administration, and data storage. Additionally, the service should be optimized for scalability and security, and should be compliant with industry standards and regulations.
